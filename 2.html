    <p>Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable. Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions are likely to find the specification changing out from under them in incompatible ways. Vendors
        interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage
        should join the aforementioned mailing lists and take part in the discussions.

        This is a work in progress!
        For the latest updates from the HTML WG, possibly including important bug fixes, please look at the editor's
        draft instead.
        The publication of this document by the W3C as a W3C Working Draft does not imply that all of the participants
        in the W3C HTML working group endorse the contents of the specification. Indeed, for any section of the
        specification, one can usually find many members of the working group or of the W3C as a whole who object
        strongly to the current text, the existence of the section at all, or the idea that the working group should
        even spend time discussing the concept of that section.</p>
